  <p>I am a 17 year old soon to be graduate from Norwoood-Norfolk Central School.  i am currently a senior and am hoping to further my education by some way but I am unsure of how I plan to expand it.  I want to go to college but I am nervous about the money, a lot of people I know claim they got in financial trouble because of college and I don't want that to happen.  I plan to try and have kids early like age 23 so I can be young for my grandchildren still without being in financial trouble, but college I fear will put me in financial trouble.</p>
